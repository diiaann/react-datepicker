# React Date Picker

Forked from https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker
## Modifications:
* Use of a modal instead of a popover, modal's display is toggled instead of messing with the DOM
* Adds PropTypes
* Removed tether bower component
* Other random things that I needed for what I was working on

## Installation

Installing is really simple and can be done in two different ways:

- Install with Bower: `bower install react-date-picker`
- Install with Bundler: `bundle install rails-assets-react-date-picker`

## Local Development

- Install Bower `npm install -g bower`
- Install Grunt CLI `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Install Bower Packages `bower install`
- Install packages `npm install`
- Start a static webserver `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- And visit `localhost:8000/example.html` to see the example.

To run tests, simply run `grunt jest`.
